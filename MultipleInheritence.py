Hello,
I am Shubham and I am 20 year old, I am from VJTI, Mumbai,
I want to become an IT Engineer in Google or Microsoft.
For this I took admission in this college.
Otherwise I had options to take admission in lower branches of IITs and higher branches in NITs.
But for my dreams, I compromised those big and high-value colleges.
